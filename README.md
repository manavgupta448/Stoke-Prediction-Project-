# Stoke-Prediction-Project-
I HAVE DOWNLOADED STROKE OCCURRENCE DATASET FROM KAGGLE AND IN THAT I HAVE APPLIED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO PREDICT STROKE OCCURRENCES Model used for predictive modelling- logistic regression model since my target variable(STROKE OCCURRENCE)is 0 or 1 that is categorical ,hence used logistic regression to predict if the stroke will occur or not .
